##  How to Use?

- Fetch Problem Data and Generate a Project Structure

  ```bash
  $ algo add --lang <programming_language> --platform <platform> <problem_id>
  ```

## Supported Platforms

The following platforms are currently supported:

- âœ… **Baekjoon** (`baekjoon`)
- âœ… **More platforms will be supported in the future!** *(Planned)*

## Planned Features
I am actively developing new features. Here are some upcoming updates:

- [ ] **Support for additional programming languages**
- [ ] **Customizable templates for different languages and platforms**
- [ ] **Ability to submit solutions directly to problem-solving sites**
- [ ] **Enhanced error handling and retry mechanism**

Stay tuned for updates! ðŸš€
